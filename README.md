# 42 Core Project 01 - libft

## 3rd March 2024
Libft is quite huge if you were doing Piscine on chill...

I have 12 libc functions and 11 additional functions still to complete. And 17 days left. That's a lot...

I need to write two functions per day in order to make it. Not to mention that in this pace I will have libft completed on 15th March -> then the weekend I am still away and 4 evenings to run the evaluations and eventual corrections.

## 4th March 2024

Ok, now two groups of functions remain, maybe three:
- libc functions requiring knowledge of the malloc() function
- additional functions
- (tricky additional functions)

I will implement today's second: ft_strnstr() which has no man but has description in the Piscine assignments

And I need to go back to TDD...
And switch off the GitHub Copilot... my mind is way tooo lazy to analyze the code it is suggesting...
