# 42 Core Project 01 - libft

## 3rd March 2024
Libft is quite huge if you were doing Piscine on chill...

I have 12 libc functions and 11 additional functions still to complete. And 17 days left. That's a lot...

I need to write two functions per day in order to make it. Not to mention that in this pace I will have libft completed on 15th March -> then the weekend I am still away and 4 evenings to run the evaluations and eventual corrections.
